# creepycrawlies
This repo is for working on web crawlers to help with research that I am doing. The webcrawler is using the Scrapy framework and running in a virtual env.

This readme as well as the files in the repo will be changing on a very regular basis.


### TODO:
* Work with headless browsers to take screenshots of pages that are crawled
* Assess current library to see if Scrapy is a good choice
* Keep tinkering
